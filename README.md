# Cisco Packet Tracer (Computer Network Lab)
This repository contains .pkt simulation files created using Cisco Packet Tracer for various computer network lab exercises. It is intended to support students and enthusiasts who want to practice and explore the fundamentals of computer networking through simulation.

## üìö Basic Definitions
Before diving into the simulations, here are a few essential terms in computer networking:

- **Computer Network:** A computer network is a group of interconnected computers that share resources and information. These networks can be wired or wireless and vary in scale from small local networks (LANs) to wide-area networks (WANs) like the Internet.

- **Host:** A host is any device (such as a computer, server, or smartphone) that can send or receive data on a network. Each host typically has an IP address for identification.

- **Router:** A router is a network device that connects different networks together. It forwards data packets between computer networks and determines the best path for data to travel.

- **Switch:** A switch is a device that connects multiple devices within the same network (usually a LAN) and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination.

- **Packet Tracer:** Cisco Packet Tracer is a powerful simulation tool developed by Cisco that allows users to create virtual network topologies, configure devices, and simulate network behavior without physical hardware.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide: Cisco Packet Tracer
To run the .pkt files provided in this repository, you need to have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your system.

### üîΩ Step 1: Download
Visit the official [Cisco Networking Academy site](https://www.netacad.com/)
Create a free account (if you don't have one).
Navigate to `Resources ‚Üí Download Packet Tracer` after logging in.
Download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows/Linux/macOS).

> [!NOTE]
> I have installed Cisco Packet Tracer v8.2.2 from [here](https://www.netacad.com/articles/news/download-cisco-packet-tracer).

### üíª Step 2: Install
- Windows:
  Run the .exe installer and follow the setup instructions.
  After installation, log in using your NetAcad credentials.

- Linux:
  - Download the .deb or .tar.gz file depending on your distro.
  - Install using the terminal (sudo dpkg -i file_name.deb) or extract and run the binary.
